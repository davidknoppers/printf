*This is a group project between Jianqin Jay Wang and David Knoppers*.

The purpose of this project is to recreate the printf function that programmers use in their code daily.

This function can handle the following modifiers:
%, c (char), s (string), d and i (decimal), u (unsigned int), o (octal), x (lower hexadecimal), X (upper hexadecimal), and b (binary).

The return value for the function is the total character count of the output.
