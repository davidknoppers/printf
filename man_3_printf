.SH NAME
.B _printf
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "holberton.h"
int _printf (const char *format, va_list ap);
.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf replicates some of the functionality of printf in c. It writes output to stdout given an optional format string and a sequence of arguments from va_list.

.B Return value
_printf returns the total bytesize of the string formatted and sent to stdout,
including non-ASCII-readable characters in the string such as the null terminator '\0'.

.B Format of the format string
The format string is a string containing zero or more characters. Ordinary characters,
e.g. 'abc', are passed by the function to stdout without modification. Conversion specifiers
such as %s are preceded by a modulo % and cause the function to fetch special formatters
and expansions. They are interpreted in the order they are passed, from left to right,
e.g. ('%a%b%c',...) formats and prints a, then b, then c. Speaking of which, %a
is not a valid specifier. Here are the actual specifiers:

%b: formats a number into binary and sends to stdout

%c: formats a char to stdout

%s: formats a string to stdout

%d, %i: formats a string to stdout. Digit padding is not implemented.

%u: formats an unsigned int to stdout

%o formats number into octal and sends to stdout

%xX: x or X formats a number into hexadecimal and sends to stdout

.SH OPTIONS
.B const char *format
The format string is totally optional. It simplifies the passing of variables
into printf, but simply passing a string will work, e.g. printf("Hello Holberton\n")

.SH SEE ALSO
.I printf(3)

.SH BUGS
Currently fails to match the formatting of printf when passed a sequence of spaces and '%' symbols. 
Does not handle printf functionality such as field width, precision and length modifiers. As of 
writing, we're also missing a few mystery checks for our %c and %s conversions so I'm pretty
sure those can be filed under 'bugs' as well.

.SH EXAMPLE
{

	int i;

	i = _printf("Good doggo spotted");

	_printf("The previous string was %d bytes long", i);

	return (0);
}
